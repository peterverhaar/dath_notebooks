She\u2019s even scored a coveted spot in the writers\u2019 room of the TV adaptation of her popular young adult novels, and if she can hide her imposter syndrome and overcome her writer\u2019s block, surely the rest of her life will fall into place too.

Anita de Monte, a rising star in the art world, is found dead in New York City; her tragic death is the talk of the town. Until it isn\u2019t. By 1998 Anita\u2019s name has been all but forgotten\u2014certainly by the time Raquel, a third-year art history student is preparing her final thesis. On College Hill, surrounded by privileged students whose futures are already paved out for them, Raquel feels like an outsider. Students of color, like her, are the minority there, and the pressure to work twice as hard for the same opportunities is no secret.<br /><br />But when Raquel becomes romantically involved with a well-connected older art student, she finds herself unexpectedly rising up the social ranks. As she attempts to straddle both worlds, she stumbles upon Anita\u2019s story, raising questions about the dynamics of her own relationship, which eerily mirrors that of the forgotten artist.<br /><br />Moving back and forth through time and told from the perspectives of both women, <i>Anita de Monte Laughs Last</i> is a propulsive, witty examination of power, love, and art, daring to ask who gets to be remembered and who is left behind in the rarefied world of the elite.",

You have all these stories inside all the stories everyone in our family knows and all the stories everyone in our family tells.

The baby of the family, Mika Tabor spends much of her time in the care of loved ones, listening to their stories and witnessing their struggles. On Redwood Court, the cul-de-sac in the all-Black working-class suburb of Columbia, South Carolina, where her grandparents live, Mika learns important lessons from the people who raise her: her exhausted parents, who work long hours at multiple jobs while still making sure their kids experience the adventure of family vacations; her older sister, who in a house filled with Motown would rather listen to Alanis Morrisette; her retired grandparents, children of Jim Crow, who realized their own vision of success when they bought their house on the Court in the 1960s, imagining it filled with future generations; and the many neighbors who hold tight to the community they\u2019ve built, committed to fostering joy and love in an America so insistent on seeing Black people stumble and fall.<br /><br />With visceral clarity and powerful prose, Dameron reveals the devastation of being made to feel invisible and the transformative power of being seen. <i>Redwood Court</i> is a celebration of extraordinary, ordinary people striving to achieve their own American dreams.",

While picking cherries, they beg their mother to tell them the story of Peter Duke, a famous actor with whom she shared both a stage and a romance years before at a theater company called Tom Lake. As Lara recalls the past, her daughters examine their own lives and relationship with their mother, and are forced to reconsider the world and everything they thought they knew.<br /><br />Tom Lake is a meditation on youthful love, married love, and the lives parents have led before their children were born. Both hopeful and elegiac, it explores what it means to be happy even when the world is falling apart.

Lots of questions.<br /><br />A celebrity in her own right, Elise St. John would rather focus on sorting out Kitty\u2019s affairs than deal with the press. But what she discovers in one of Kitty\u2019s journals rocks her world harder than any other brewing scandal could\u2014and between a cheating fianc\u00e9 and the fallout from a controversial social media post, there are plenty.<br /><br />The truth behind Kitty's ascent to stardom from her beginnings in the segregated South threatens to expose a web of unexpected family ties, debts owed, and debatable crimes that could, with one pull, unravel the all-American fabric of the St. John sisters and those closest to them.<br /><br />As Elise digs deeper into Kitty's past, she must also turn the lens upon herself, confronting the gifts and burdens of her own choices and the power that the secrets of the dead hold over the living. <i>Did You Hear About Kitty Karr?</i> is a sprawling page-turner set against the backdrop of the Hollywood machine, an insightful and nuanced look at the inheritances of family, race, and gender\u2014and the choices some women make to break free of them.",

With a couple of heartbreaks under her belt, she\u2019s long abandoned the search for love, settling instead for the occasional hook-up, career success, and a close relationship with her stepfather to round out a satisfying life.<br /> <br />But when Sally\u2019s friend and fellow writer Danny Horst begins dating Annabel, a glamorous actor who guest-hosted the show, he joins the not-so-exclusive group of talented but average-looking and even dorky men at the show\u2014and in society at large\u2014who\u2019ve gotten romantically involved with incredibly beautiful and accomplished women. Sally channels her annoyance into a sketch called the \"Danny Horst Rule,\" poking fun at this phenomenon while underscoring how unlikely it is that the reverse would ever happen for a woman.<br /> <br />Enter Noah Brewster, a pop music sensation with a reputation for dating models, who signed on as both host and musical guest for this week\u2019s show. Dazzled by his charms, Sally hits it off with Noah instantly, and as they collaborate on one sketch after another, she begins to wonder whether there might actually be sparks flying. But this isn\u2019t a romantic comedy; it\u2019s real life. And in real life, someone like him would never date someone like her...right?<br /> <br />With her keen observations and trademark ability to bring complex women to life on the page, Sittenfeld explores the neurosis-inducing and heart-fluttering wonder of love, while slyly dissecting the social rituals of romance and gender relations in the modern age.",

Lucrezia, third daughter of the grand duke, is comfortable with her obscure place in the palazzo: free to wonder at its treasures, observe its clandestine workings, and devote herself to her own artistic pursuits. But when her older sister dies on the eve of her wedding to the ruler of Ferrara, Modena and Reggio, Lucrezia is thrust unwittingly into the limelight: the duke is quick to request her hand in marriage, and her father just as quick to accept on her behalf.<br /> <br />Having barely left girlhood behind, Lucrezia must now enter an unfamiliar court whose customs are opaque and where her arrival is not universally welcomed. Perhaps most mystifying of all is her new husband himself, Alfonso. Is he the playful sophisticate he appeared to be before their wedding, the aesthete happiest in the company of artists and musicians, or the ruthless politician before whom even his formidable sisters seem to tremble?<br /> <br />As Lucrezia sits in constricting finery for a painting intended to preserve her image for centuries to come, one thing becomes worryingly clear. In the court\u2019s eyes, she has one duty: to provide the heir who will shore up the future of the Ferranese dynasty. Until then, for all of her rank and nobility, the new duchess\u2019s future hangs entirely in the balance.<br /> <br />Full of the beauty and emotion with which she illuminated the Shakespearean canvas of <i>Hamnet</i>, Maggie O\u2019Farrell turns her talents to Renaissance Italy in an extraordinary portrait of a resilient young woman\u2019s battle for her very survival.",

Ruth, Esther, and Chloe have been singing and dancing in harmony since they could speak. Thanks to the rigorous direction of their mother, Vivian, they\u2019ve become a bona fide girl group whose shows are the talk of the Jazz-era Fillmore. <br /><br />Now Vivian has scored a once-in-a-lifetime offer from a talent manager, who promises to catapult The Salvations into the national spotlight. Vivian knows this is the big break she\u2019s been praying for. But sometime between the hours of rehearsal on their rooftop and the weekly gigs at the Champagne Supper Club, the girls have become women, women with dreams that their mother cannot imagine. <br /><br />The neighborhood is changing, too: all around the Fillmore, white men in suits are approaching Black property owners with offers. One sister finds herself called to fight back, one falls into the comfort of an old relationship, another yearns to make her own voice heard. And Vivian, who has always maintained control, will have to confront the parts of her life that threaten to splinter: the community, The Salvations, and even her family.",

They taste the best when together...</em><br /><br />Sharp-tongued (and secretly soft-hearted) Kiki Banjo has just made a huge mistake. As an expert in relationship-evasion and the host of the popular student radio show <em>Brown Sugar</em>, she's made it her mission to make sure the women of the African-Caribbean Society at Whitewell University do not fall into the mess of \"situationships\", players, and heartbreak. But when the Queen of the Unbothered kisses Malakai Korede, the guy she just publicly denounced as \"The Wastemen of Whitewell,\" in front of every Blackwellian on campus, she finds her show on the brink.<br /><br />They're soon embroiled in a fake relationship to try and salvage their reputations and save their futures. Kiki has never surrendered her heart before, and a player like Malakai won't be the one to change that, no matter how charming he is or how electric their connection feels. But surprisingly entertaining study sessions and intimate, late-night talks at old-fashioned diners force Kiki to look beyond her own presumptions. Is she ready to open herself up to something deeper?<br /><br />A gloriously funny and sparkling debut novel, <em>Honey and Spice</em> is full of delicious tension and romantic intrigue that will make you weak at the knees.",

As a strait-laced, rule-abiding Chinese American lawyer with a successful surgeon as a husband, a young son, and a beautiful home--she's built the perfect life. But beneath this fa\u00e7ade, Ava's world is crumbling: her marriage is falling apart, her expensive law degree hasn't been used in years, and her toddler's tantrums are pushing her to the breaking point.<br /><br />Enter Winnie Fang, Ava's enigmatic college roommate from Mainland China, who abruptly dropped out under mysterious circumstances. Now, twenty years later, Winnie is looking to reconnect with her old friend. But the shy, awkward girl Ava once knew has been replaced with a confident woman of the world, dripping in luxury goods, including a coveted Birkin in classic orange. The secret to her success? Winnie has developed an ingenious counterfeit scheme that involves importing near-exact replicas of luxury handbags and now she needs someone with a U.S. passport to help manage her business--someone who'd never be suspected of wrongdoing, someone like Ava. But when their spectacular success is threatened and Winnie vanishes once again, Ava is left to face the consequences.<br /><br />Swift, surprising, and sharply comic, <em>Counterfeit</em> is a stylish and feminist caper with a strong point of view and an axe to grind. Peering behind the curtain of the upscale designer storefronts and the Chinese factories where luxury goods are produced, Kirstin Chen interrogates the myth of the model minority through two unforgettable women determined to demand more from life.",

Motherless and irrepressibly curious, she spends her childhood in the Scriptorium, an Oxford garden shed in which her father and a team of dedicated lexicographers are collecting words for the very first Oxford English Dictionary. Young Esme\u2019s place is beneath the sorting table, unseen and unheard. One day a slip of paper containing the word bondmaid flutters beneath the table. She rescues the slip and, learning that the word means \u201cslave girl,\u201d begins to collect other words that have been discarded or neglected by the dictionary men.<br /><br />As she grows up, Esme realizes that words and meanings relating to women\u2019s and common folks\u2019 experiences often go unrecorded. And so she begins in earnest to search out words for her own dictionary: the Dictionary of Lost Words. To do so she must leave the sheltered world of the university and venture out to meet the people whose words will fill those pages.<br /><br />Set during the height of the women\u2019s suffrage movement and with the Great War looming, <i>The Dictionary of Lost Words</i> reveals a lost narrative, hidden between the lines of a history written by men. Inspired by actual events, author Pip Williams has delved into the archives of the Oxford English Dictionary to tell this highly original story. <i>The Dictionary of Lost Words</i> is a delightful, lyrical, and deeply thought-provoking celebration of words and the power of language to shape the world.",

But the dual love stories of <i>Honor </i>are as different as the cultures of Meena and Smita themselves: Smita realizes she has the freedom to enter into a casual affair, knowing she can decide later how much it means to her.<br /><br /> In this tender and evocative novel about love, hope, familial devotion, betrayal, and sacrifice, Thrity Umrigar shows us two courageous women trying to navigate how to be true to their homelands and themselves at the same time.",

She's ready to start a brand-new life, with a new identity--when things go sideways. Lucky finds herself alone for the first time, navigating the world without the help of either her father or her boyfriend, the two figures from whom she's learned the art of the scam.<br /><br />When she discovers that a lottery ticket she bought on a whim is worth millions, her elation is tempered by one big problem: cashing in the winning ticket means she'll be arrested for her crimes. She'll go to prison, with no chance to redeem her fortune.<br /><br />As Lucky tries to avoid capture and make a future for herself, she must confront her past by reconciling with her father; finding her mother, who abandoned her when she was just a baby; and coming to terms with the man she thought she loved--whose dark past is catching up with her, too.<br /><br />This is a novel about truth, personal redemption, and the complexity of being good. It introduces a singularly gifted, multilayered character who must learn what it means to be independent and honest ... before her luck runs out.",

In the taverna, hidden beneath garlands of garlic, chili peppers and creeping honeysuckle, Kostas and Defne grow in their forbidden love for each other. A fig tree stretches through a cavity in the roof, and this tree bears witness to their hushed, happy meetings and eventually, to their silent, surreptitious departures. The tree is there when war breaks out, when the capital is reduced to ashes and rubble, and when the teenagers vanish. Decades later, Kostas returns. He is a botanist looking for native species, but really, he's searching for lost love.<br /><br />Years later a Ficus carica grows in the back garden of a house in London where Ada Kazantzakis lives. This tree is her only connection to an island she has never visited--- her only connection to her family's troubled history and her complex identity as she seeks to untangle years of secrets to find her place in the world.<br /><br />A moving, beautifully written, and delicately constructed story of love, division, transcendence, history, and eco-consciousness, <i>The Island of Missing Trees</i> is Elif Shafak's best work yet.",

The IRA may have gone underground after the Good Friday agreement, but they never really went away, and lately, bomb threats, arms drops, and helicopters floating ominously over the city have become features of everyday life. As the anchor requests the public's help in locating those responsible for this latest raid - a robbery at a gas station - Tessa's sister appears on the screen. Tessa watches in shock as Marian pulls a black mask over her face.<br /><br />The police believe Marian has joined the IRA, but Tessa knows this is impossible. They were raised to oppose Republicanism, and the violence enacted in its name. They've attended peace vigils together. And besides, Marian is vacationing by the sea. Tessa just spoke to her yesterday.<br /><br />When the truth of what has happened to Marian reveals itself, Tessa will be forced to choose: between her ideals and her family, between bystanderism and action. Walking an increasingly perilous road, she fears nothing more than endangering the one person she loves more fiercely than her sister: her infant son.<br /><br />A riveting and exquisite novel about family, terror, motherhood, betrayal, and the staggering human costs of an intractable conflict, <i>Northern Spy </i>cements Flynn Berry's status as one of the most sophisticated and accomplished authors of crime and suspense novels working today.",

She urgently needs to get out and get back home to Bogot\u00e1, where her father and a plane ticket to the United States are waiting for her. If she misses her flight, she might also miss her chance to finally be reunited with her family in the north.<br /><br />How this family came to occupy two different countries, two different worlds, comes into focus like twists of a kaleidoscope. We see Talia\u2019s parents, Mauro and Elena, fall in love in a market stall as teenagers against a backdrop of civil war and social unrest. We see them leave Bogot\u00e1 with their firstborn, Karina, in pursuit of safety and opportunity in the United States on a temporary visa, and we see the births of two more children, Nando and Talia, on American soil. We witness the decisions and indecisions that lead to Mauro\u2019s deportation and the family\u2019s splintering\u2014the costs they\u2019ve all been living with ever since.<br /><br />Award-winning, internationally acclaimed author Patricia Engel, herself a dual citizen and the daughter of Colombian immigrants, gives voice to all five family members as they navigate the particulars of their respective circumstances. And all the while, the metronome ticks: Will Talia make it to Bogot\u00e1 in time? And if she does, can she bring herself to trade the solid facts of her father and life in Colombia for the distant vision of her mother and siblings in America?<br /><br />Rich with Bogot\u00e1 urban life, steeped in Andean myth, and tense with the daily reality of the undocumented in America, <i>Infinite Country</i> is the story of two countries and one mixed-status family\u2014for whom every triumph is stitched with regret, and every dream pursued bears the weight of a dream deferred.",

But then the Trifecta happened, and everything\u2014including Lila herself\u2014fell apart.<br /><br />Worried about Lila\u2019s mental health, her parents make a new plan for her: spend three months with family friends in Winchester, England, to relax and reset. But with the lack of sun, a grumpy inn cook, and a small town lacking Miami flavor (both in food and otherwise), what would be a dream trip for some feels more like a nightmare to Lila\u2026until she meets Orion Maxwell.<br /><br />A teashop clerk with troubles of his own, Orion is determined to help Lila out of her funk, and appoints himself as her personal tour guide. From Winchester\u2019s drama-filled music scene to the sweeping English countryside, it isn\u2019t long before Lila is not only charmed by Orion, but England itself. Soon a new future is beginning to form in Lila\u2019s mind\u2014one that would mean leaving everything she ever planned behind.",

Why then was she driving through Chicago fantasizing about her own death? Why was she envisioning putting an end to the isolation and sadness that still plagued her in spite of her achievements?<br /><br />Enter Dr. Rosen, a therapist who calmly assures her that if she joins one of his psychotherapy groups, he can transform her life. All she has to do is show up and be honest. About everything\u2014her eating habits, childhood, sexual history, etc. Christie is skeptical, insisting that that she is defective, beyond cure. But Dr. Rosen issues a nine-word prescription that will change everything: \u201cYou don\u2019t need a cure, you need a witness.<br /><br />So begins her entry into the strange, terrifying, and ultimately life-changing world of group therapy. Christie is initially put off by Dr. Rosen\u2019s outlandish directives, but as her defenses break down and she comes to trust Dr. Rosen and to depend on the sessions and the prescribed nightly phone calls with various group members, she begins to understand what it means to connect.<br /><br /><i>Group</i> is a deliciously addictive read, and with Christie as our guide\u2014skeptical of her own capacity for connection and intimacy, but hopeful in spite of herself\u2014we are given a front row seat to the daring, exhilarating, painful, and hilarious journey that is group therapy\u2014an under-explored process that breaks you down, and then reassembles you so that all the pieces finally fit.",

        "description": "<b>From a powerful new voice on racial justice, an eye-opening account of growing up Black, Christian, and female in middle-class white America. </b><br /><br />Austin Channing Brown's first encounter with a racialized America came at age 7, when she discovered her parents named her Austin to deceive future employers into thinking she was a white man. Growing up in majority-white schools, organizations, and churches, Austin writes, \"I had to learn what it means to love blackness,\" a journey that led to a lifetime spent navigating America's racial divide as a writer, speaker and expert who helps organizations practice genuine inclusion.<br /><br />In a time when nearly all institutions (schools, churches, universities, businesses) claim to value \"diversity\" in their mission statements, <i>I'm Still Here</i> is a powerful account of how and why our actions so often fall short of our words. Austin writes in breathtaking detail about her journey to self-worth and the pitfalls that kill our attempts at racial justice, in stories that bear witness to the complexity of America's social fabric--from Black Cleveland neighborhoods to private schools in the middle-class suburbs, from prison walls to the boardrooms at majority-white organizations.<br /><br />For readers who have engaged with America's legacy on race through the writing of Ta-Nehisi Coates and Michael Eric Dyson, <i>I'm Still Here</i> is an illuminating look at how white, middle-class, Evangelicalism has participated in an era of rising racial hostility, inviting the reader to confront apathy, recognize God's ongoing work in the world, and discover how blackness--if we let it--can save us all.",

Will is a rising television star, handsome and charming. Jules is a smart, ambitious magazine publisher. Though the sea is a little choppy and the cell service spotty, their wedding is everything you'd expect of a young power couple: designer dress, four-tiered cake, boutique whiskey, vintage champagne. Every detail has been curated to perfection. All that's left to orchestrate is the happiness.<br /><br />But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. It's not long after the cake is cut and the champagne popped that resentments and petty jealousies come out. Worse yet, the latest barometer reading shows the weather has shifted from FAIR to CHANGEABLE, and dark clouds are looming overhead.<br /><br />Everyone on the island has a secret. Everyone has a motive. And someone won't leave this wedding alive...",

Tired of being the \"shefault\" parent responsible for all aspects of her busy household, Eve Rodsky counted up all the unpaid, invisible work she was doing for her family -- and then sent that list to her husband, asking for things to change. His response was... underwhelming. Rodsky realized that simply identifying the issue of unequal labor on the home front wasn't enough: She needed a <i>solution</i> to this universal problem. Her sanity, identity, career (and her marriage) depended on it.<br /><br />The result is Fair Play: a time- and anxiety-saving system that offers couples a completely new way to divvy up domestic responsibilities. Rodsky interviewed more than five hundred men and women from all walks of life to figure out what the invisible work in a family actually entails and how to get it all done efficiently. With four easy-to-follow rules, 100 household tasks, and a figurative card game you play with your partner, <i>Fair Play </i>helps you prioritize what's important to your family and who should take the lead on every chore from laundry to homework to dinner.<br /><br />\"Winning\" this game means rebalancing your home life, reigniting your relationship with your significant other, and reclaiming your Unicorn Space -- as in, the time to develop the skills and passions that keep you interested and interesting. Are you ready to try Fair Play? Let's deal you in.",

        "description": "A poignant and transporting cross-cultural love story set against the lush backdrop of the Sicilian countryside, where one woman discovers the healing powers of food, family, and unexpected grace in her darkest hour.<br /><br />It was love at first sight when Tembi met professional chef, Saro, on a street in Florence. There was just one problem: Saro\u2019s traditional Sicilian family did not approve of him marrying a black American woman, an actress no less. However, the couple, heartbroken but undeterred, forges on. They build a happy life in Los Angeles, with fulfilling careers, deep friendships and the love of their lives: a baby girl they adopt at birth. Eventually, they reconcile with Saro\u2019s family just as he faces a formidable cancer that will consume all their dreams.<br /> <br /> <i>From Scratch </i>chronicles three summers Tembi spends in Sicily with her daughter, Zoela, as she begins to piece together a life without her husband in his tiny hometown hamlet of farmers. Where once Tembi was estranged from Saro\u2019s family and his origins, now she finds solace and nourishment\u2014literally and spiritually\u2014at her mother in law\u2019s table. In the Sicilian countryside, she discovers the healing gifts of simple fresh food, the embrace of a close knit community, and timeless traditions and wisdom that light a path forward. All along the way she reflects on her and Saro\u2019s incredible romance\u2014an indelible love story that leaps off the pages.<br /> <br /> In Sicily, it is said that every story begins with a marriage or a death\u2014in Tembi Locke\u2019s case, it is both. Her story is about loss, but it\u2019s really about love found. Her story is about travel, but it\u2019s really about finding a home. It is about food, but it\u2019s really about chasing flavor as an act of remembrance. <i>From Scratch </i>is for anyone who has dared to reach for big love, fought for what mattered most, and needed a powerful reminder that life is\u2026delicious.",

        "description": "On the morning of April 29, 1986, a fire alarm sounded in the Los Angeles Public Library. As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, \u201cOnce that first stack got going, it was \u2018Goodbye, Charlie.\u2019\u201d The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library\u2014and if so, who?<br /> <br /> Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning <i>New Yorker </i>reporter and <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before.<br /> <br /> In <i>The Library Book</i>, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago.<br /> <br /> Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and present\u2014from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as \u201cThe Human Encyclopedia\u201d who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves.<br /> <br /> Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, <i>The Library Book </i>is Susan Orlean\u2019s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just books\u2014and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country. It is also a master journalist\u2019s reminder that, perhaps especially in the digital era, they are more necessary than ever.",

So in late 1969, when the popular Chase Andrews is found dead, locals immediately suspect her.<br /><br />But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world\u2013until the unthinkable happens.<br /><br />In Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting mystery. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens\u2019s debut novel reminds us that we are forever shaped by the child within us, while also subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.<br /><br />The story asks how isolation influences the behavior of a young woman, who like all of us, has the genetic propensity to belong to a group. The clues to the mystery are brushed into the lush habitat and natural histories of its wild creatures.",

A high-powered lawyer honeymooning with her husband is caught off guard by the appearance of the girl who tormented her in high school. A shy Ivy League student learns the truth about a classmate's seemingly enviable life.<br /><br />Curtis Sittenfeld has established a reputation as a sharp chronicler of the modern age who humanizes her subjects even as she skewers them. Throughout the ten stories in <i>You Think It, I'll Say It, </i> Sittenfeld upends assumptions about class, relationships, and gender roles in a nation that feels both adrift and viscerally divided.<br /><br />With moving insight and uncanny precision, Curtis Sittenfeld pinpoints the questionable decisions, missed connections, and sometimes extraordinary coincidences that make up a life. Indeed, she writes what we're all thinking--if only we could express it with the wit of a master satirist, the storytelling gifts of an old-fashioned raconteur, and the vision of an American original.",

Their magical interlude ends, full stop, when Heather becomes pregnant\u2014Brian is sure he loves her, only he doesn't want kids. Heather returns to California to deliver their daughter alone, buoyed by family and friends. Mere hours after Gracie's arrival, Heather's bliss is interrupted when a nurse wakes her, \"Get dressed, your baby is in trouble.\"<br /><br />This is not how Heather had imagined new motherhood \u2013 alone, heartsick, an unexpectedly solo caretaker of a baby who smelled \"like sliced apples and salted pretzels\" but might be perilously ill. Brian reappears as Gracie's condition grows dire; together Heather and Brian have to decide what they are willing to risk to ensure their girl sees adulthood.<br /><br />The grace and humor that ripple through Harpham's writing transform the dross of heartbreak and parental fears into a clear-eyed, warm-hearted view of the world. Profoundly moving and subtly written, <i>Happiness</i> radiates in many directions--new, romantic love; gratitude for a beautiful, inscrutable world; deep, abiding friendship; the passion a parent has for a child; and the many unlikely ways to build a family.

        "description": "<b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER - A timely and important book that challenges everything we think we know about cultivating true belonging in our communities, organizations, and culture, from the #1 bestselling author of <i>Rising Strong, Daring Greatly, </i>and <i>The Gifts of Imperfection</i></b><br /><b><br /><b>Look for Bren\ufffd Brown's new podcast, <i>Dare to Lead, </i> as well as her ongoing podcast <i>Unlocking Us</i>!</b> </b><br /><br />HELLO SUNSHINE BOOK CLUB PICK<br /> <br />\"True belonging doesn't require us to <i>change</i> who we are. It requires us to <i>be</i> who we are.\" Social scientist Bren\ufffd Brown, PhD, LMSW, has sparked a global conversation about the experiences that bring meaning to our lives--experiences of courage, vulnerability, love, belonging, shame, and empathy. In <i>Braving the Wilderness, </i> Brown redefines what it means to truly belong in an age of increased polarization. With her trademark mix of research, storytelling, and honesty, Brown will again change the cultural conversation while mapping a clear path to true belonging.<br /><br />Brown argues that we're experiencing a spiritual crisis of disconnection, and introduces four practices of true belonging that challenge everything we believe about ourselves and each other. She writes, \"True belonging requires us to believe in and belong to ourselves so fully that we can find sacredness both in being a part of something and in standing alone when necessary. But in a culture that's rife with perfectionism and pleasing, and with the erosion of civility, it's easy to stay quiet, hide in our ideological bunkers, or fit in rather than show up as our true selves and brave the wilderness of uncertainty and criticism. But true belonging is not something we negotiate or accomplish with others; it's a daily practice that demands integrity and authenticity. It's a personal commitment that we carry in our hearts.\" Brown offers us the clarity and courage we need to find our way back to ourselves and to each other. And that path cuts right through the wilderness. Brown writes, \"The wilderness is an untamed, unpredictable place of solitude and searching. It is a place as dangerous as it is breathtaking, a place as sought after as it is feared. But it turns out to be the place of true belonging, and it's the bravest and most sacred place you will ever stand.\"",

Writing nonfiction, which started off as a means of keeping her insufficiently lucrative fiction afloat, evolved over time to be its own kind of art, the art of telling the truth as opposed to the art of making things up. Bringing her narrative gifts to bear on her own life, Patchett uses insight and compassion to turn very personal experiences into stories that will resonate with every reader.<br /><br />These essays twine to create both a portrait of life and a philosophy of life. Obstacles that at first appear insurmountable\u2014scaling a six-foot wall in order to join the Los Angeles Police Department, opening an independent bookstore, and sitting down to write a novel\u2014are eventually mastered with quiet tenacity and sheer force of will. The actual happy marriage, which was the one thing she felt she wasn't capable of, ultimately proves to be a metaphor as well as a fact: Patchett has devoted her life to the people and ideals she loves the most. An irresistible blend of literature and memoir, <em>This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage</em> is a unique examination of the heart, mind, and soul of one of our most revered and gifted writers.",

Before she can stop him, the dog charges into the water to retrieve what first appears to be a wayward stick, but to her horror, turns out to be something much more sinister\u2026<br /><br />The next morning, three women in and around London\u2014Fatima, Thea, and Isa\u2014receive the text they had always hoped would never come, from the fourth in their formerly inseparable clique, Kate, that says only, \u201cI need you.\u201d<br /><br />The four girls were best friends at Salten, a second-rate boarding school set near the cliffs of the English Channel. Each different in their own way, the four became inseparable and were notorious for playing the Lying Game, telling lies at every turn to both fellow boarders and faculty. But their little game had consequences, and as the four converge in present-day Salten, they realize their shared past was not as safely buried as they had once hoped\u2026",
